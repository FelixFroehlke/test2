# template-labview
 A repository used for templating other repositories with a consistent and well-thought-out default set of files when developing with the LabVIEW IDE

# Getting started

1. use this template to create your new repository
1. Adjust this readme
1. Place your code and framework in the project root `/`
1. Review all files and adjust them. **Really do read every file! There are more steps to complete in them, at the place they belong.**
1. Adjust the repository settings in GitHub
     - Repository visibility (Leadec default = internal)
     - Branch Protection Rules (Leadec default = push-to-main only via reviewed PR: 4-eyes-principle, bypass for repo admins)
     - Add your collaborators (Leadec default = at least 2 admins, adhere to least priviledge principle)
     - Disable unused features (Leadec default = disable wiki/issues in favor of confluence/jira)

## Other Important Files

- Adjust the `.gitmessage`
- Override the `LICENSE` file using one of the GitHub provided templates
- Adjust the `CHANGELOG` file to document relevant changes between versions
